# apt.sh
This is a user-friendly shell wrapper for `pacman` in `msys2`, you can use it just as using the real `apt` in a debian system.

## Why not just use pacman
Because `pacman` sucks.

Most commands are similar to the real `apt`'s commands, except that:
- `list` accepts a `regular expression` argument instead of a `glob pattern` argument
- `install` and `reinstall` can also accept urls as arguments
- `--mark-auto` will mark packages as automatically installed in any cases
- `mark` is similar to `apt-mark`
- `-l` and `-s` are similar to `dpkg -L` and `dpkg -S` respectively

**Note**:
- `mark --hold` and `mark --unhold` work just like the `apt-mark` command which doesn't support `glob pattern` arguments.

## Installation
```bash
curl -Lfo /usr/local/bin/apt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beavailable/apt.sh/main/apt.sh
```

## Uninstallation
```bash
rm -f /usr/local/bin/apt /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/apt
```

## Tips
After installing the completion file, in all cases that a package name is needed as an argument, you can simply type `-<tab>` to complete the current `MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX` for you.

For example, if you type `apt install -<tab>`, you'll get:
- `apt install mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-` in `UCRT64` environment
- `apt install mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-` in `CLANG64` environment
- `apt install -` in `MSYS` environment (no changes)

And because of this, you need to type `--<tab>` to complete options in these cases.
